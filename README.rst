Build
-----

GeoGit is built using Maven::
  
  cd src/parent
  mvn clean install

Online tests, require a geogit endpoint, are available using::

  mvn -Ponline

Cobertura is configured for a test coverage report::

  mvn cobertura:cobertura
  open target/site/cobertura/index.html
    
Any additional build profiles are documented in the root `pom.xml`:pom.xml .

If you would like to work in Eclipse use of the `m2eclipse plugin <http://www.sonatype.org/m2eclipse>`_ recommended.

Please carefully apply the code formatting options in the buld/eclipse/formatter.xml file. These are the standard
Java formatting options with 100 character line length for both code and comments, and 4 spaces for indentation.
It is also recommended to use the code templates from build/eclipse/codetemlates.xml.
